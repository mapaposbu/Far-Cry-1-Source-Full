Proshow Producer 503297 is a powerful software for creating professional slideshows and videos. However, many users have encountered problems with activating their registration keys after Photodex, the company behind Proshow, shut down its servers in 2020. This article will show you how to bypass the activation server and use Proshow Producer 503297 without any limitations.
 
## Method 1: Replace Three .dnt Files
 
This method involves replacing three .dnt files in the Proshow installation directory with patched ones that will disable the registration key requirement. You will need to download the patched files from this link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X9Z4x7yY6L8wV7lQ6f4Q6q3uq3b8Wg9o/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X9Z4x7yY6L8wV7lQ6f4Q6q3uq3b8Wg9o/view) [^1^]. Here are the steps to follow:
 
**Download âœ” [https://distlittblacem.blogspot.com/?l=2uEdus](https://distlittblacem.blogspot.com/?l=2uEdus)**


 
1. Go to the Proshow installation directory, usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Photodex\Proshow Producer
2. Rename the all.dnt file to all2.dnt (the one already on your C drive, not the new downloaded one. Same goes for the next two files.)
3. Rename the if.dnt file to if2.dnt
4. Rename the pshow.dnt file to pshow2.dnt
5. Copy the three .dnt files from the zip file you downloaded into this same directory
6. Run Proshow and enjoy!

## Method 2: Delete Two .cfg and .phd Files
 
This method involves deleting two files in the Proshow installation directory that store some configuration and license information. This will remove any banners that display "Evaluation Copy" or "Use Illegally". Here are the steps to follow:
 
ProShow Gold serial number,  ProShow Registration Key activation server unavailable,  ProShow license key retrieval from Windows registry,  ProShow Gold full version download,  ProShow Producer patch files download,  ProShow Music Library access,  ProShow Gold evaluation copy removal,  ProShow Producer custom video file publishing,  ProShow Gold vs Producer comparison,  ProShow Producer online publishing issues,  ProShow Gold crack download,  ProShow Producer installation directory location,  ProShow Gold banner display fix,  ProShow Producer net energy gain,  ProShow Gold aspect ratio settings,  ProShow Producer Photopia migration,  ProShow Gold quality settings,  ProShow Producer Photodex server access,  ProShow Gold type settings,  ProShow Producer Facebook Page support,  ProShow Gold Photodex closure explanation,  ProShow Producer .dnt file replacement,  ProShow Gold Photopia discount code,  ProShow Producer for computers option,  ProShow Gold Photodex customer data transfer,  ProShow Producer proshow.cfg and proshow.phd file deletion,  ProShow Gold Photodex official website link,  ProShow Producer YouTube upload tutorial,  ProShow Gold 25 for Producer 21 for Gold registry path,  ProShow Producer Choice Slides blog post link,  ProShow Gold trial time extension,  ProShow Producer serial key generator download,  ProShow Gold software company contact information,  ProShow Producer community sharing platform link,  ProShow Gold software update notification,  ProShow Producer license key purchase link,  ProShow Gold software compatibility check,  ProShow Producer software features overview,  ProShow Gold software installation guide,  ProShow Producer software uninstallation guide

1. Go to the Proshow installation directory, usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Proshow\Producer
2. Delete the proshow.cfg and proshow.phd files. They will be rebuilt when you run Proshow again.
3. Run Proshow and enter your registration key under the Help tab.

## Tips for Publishing and Retrieving Your Registration Key
 
If you want to publish your shows to your computer or online platforms, you need to avoid using some options that will link to Photodex's servers, which are no longer functional. Here are some tips:

- Under the Publish menu or tab, select "For Computers" and then "Custom Video File". Choose your preferred settings and click on "Create". Do not select "Video For Web, Devices and Computers", "Publish Show", "YouTube", "Facebook", or other online options.
- If you want to upload your shows to YouTube or other sites, do it manually after publishing them to your computer or external drive.
- If you lost your registration key, you can retrieve it from the Windows registry by navigating to this path: HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Photodex\ProShow\license\install\25 (25 for Producer, 21 for Gold). Your registration key should be displayed under "Data". [^2^]
